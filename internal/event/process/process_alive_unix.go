// Alive reports whether a process with the given PID is currently running.
// Returns false for non-positive PIDs without performing any syscall.
//
// On Unix this uses signal 0 (syscall.Kill(pid, 0)), which performs the
// normal permission/existence check without delivering a signal:
//   - nil error            → process exists and we have permission
//   - syscall.EPERM        → process exists but owned by another user
//     (still counts as alive for our purpose)
//   - syscall.ESRCH        → no such process
//
// Any other error is treated as "alive" defensively, so we never steal a
// lock based on an ambiguous syscall failure.
